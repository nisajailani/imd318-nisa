    <p> My name is 
        <b><i>Quratun Nisa' Binti Jailani</b></i>, 
        a 20-year-old girl, that was born on 
        <strong>31st March 2004</strong> at 
        <em>Hospital Besar Kuala Lumpur</em> 
        and lived in 
        <strong>Hulu Langat, Selangor</strong> 
        for the whole 20 years old. However, since child, me and my family 
        always went to my grandparent‚Äôs house at Ampang, Selangor every morning and went back to 
        our house at night for some reason. Basically, I could consider myself growing up with both my 
        grandparents until now as they always taking care of me since kindergarten until primary school 
        when my parents go to work.</p>

    <p> Living as a child, I grow up with so many ambition. 
        <i>A teacher? A lecturer? A doctor? A chef?</i> 
        I have imagined myself as them before. Other than loving cats, I love reading both 
        <strong>Malay and English books</strong> 
        from many genre including fiction, young adult, thriller and non-fiction. Sometimes, I like to read books from 
        Indonesia too. Aside from that, I love listening to songs. I could listen to them even when I was 
        studying, reading or in the verge of sleeping. I prefer to listen to K-pop, T-pop, English songs, 
        Malay songs and sometimes other different foreign language. I might not a movie or a drama 
        watchers, but some‚Äôs even got a place in my heart too.</p>
