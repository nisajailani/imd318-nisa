        <p>
            My name is <b><i>Quratun Nisa' Binti Jailani</i></b>, a 20-year-old girl, born on 
            <strong>31<sup>st</sup> March 2004</strong> at <em>Hospital Besar Kuala Lumpur</em>. 
            I have lived in <strong>Hulu Langat, Selangor</strong> my entire life with my parents and two other siblings. However, since childhood, my family 
            and I would visit my grandparent's house in <u>Ampang, Selangor</u>, every morning and return home at night. 
            I was fortunate to grow up under the care of my grandparents, who looked after me from kindergarten to primary school while my parents were at work.

        <p class="section-title">More About Me (QURATUN NISA')</p>
        <p>
            Growing up, I dreamed of many professions—<i>a teacher, a lecturer, a doctor, a chef</i>. Other than loving cats, 
            I adore reading both <strong>Malay and English books</strong> across genres, including fiction, young adult, thriller, 
            and non-fiction. Occasionally, I read books from Indonesia too. I also enjoy listening to music, whether I'm 
            studying, reading, or falling asleep. My preferences span <b>K-pop, T-pop, English, Malay</b>, and even songs 
            in other foreign languages. Although I’m not a movie or drama enthusiast, a few have left a lasting impression on me.
